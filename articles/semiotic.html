                <p>This project investigates the cultural and symbolic meanings attached to tea across various social classes—from affluent consumers who favor premium, artisanal blends to lower-income groups who rely on mass-produced or locally sourced tea. So far, the project has been structured through a comprehensive literature review, development of a semi-structured interview guide, and a pilot study. Preliminary interviews and focus groups have been conducted to refine research questions, ensuring the approach captures both overt usage patterns and deeper semiotic interpretations.</p>

                <p>Context:<br><br>Tea is a universally consumed beverage that carries a spectrum of meanings and cultural significances. For the affluent, tea may represent a refined lifestyle, an element of a health-conscious regimen, or even a symbol of luxury when sourced from boutique tea houses. For middle- and lower-income consumers, tea can be a daily comfort, an affordable means of social connection, or a tradition steeped in cultural heritage. This research explores how different social classes interpret tea—not only as a beverage but as a carrier of lifestyle, identity, and socio-economic status.</p>

                        <p class="mb-0"><strong>Example:</strong><br><strong>Affluent Consumers:</strong> Often prefer loose-leaf or specialty blends, viewing tea as part of a holistic approach to well-being and elegance. Packaging, presentation, and brand stories are central to the tea's meaning.<br><br><strong>Lower-Income Consumers:</strong> May choose more economical, bagged teas, where tea functions as a daily ritual that provides comfort and continuity with cultural practices.<br><br></p>

                <p>Approach Details:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Semi-Structured Interviews: Develop an interview guide with open-ended questions aimed at uncovering why individuals choose specific types of tea, how they source it, and what meanings they attach to its consumption.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus Groups: Organize group discussions to observe interactions and the negotiation of meaning among peers. This reveals shared cultural narratives and variations in perception across different classes.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;Observational Research: Visit various tea-selling venues—from upscale specialty tea shops to local grocery stores and street vendors—to understand the environmental context and presentation of tea as a product.</p>
