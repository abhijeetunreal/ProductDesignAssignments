                        <p>Hmm, as a college student, what bugs me daily? Let me think. Maybe things like losing stationery, forgetting where I put my keys, phone running out of battery during the day, Also some time I Forget to Live in the Present Moment. Oh, yeah, carrying a heavy bag around campus. Also, my notes get messy, or I can't find them when I need to study. Maybe the mess in my dorm room? Or not having enough storage space.<br>Wait, what else? Maybe laundry issues, like mixing whites and colors accidentally. Or not having a place to dry clothes quickly. Oh, charging ports in public places are always taken. Or my earphones get tangled every time I put them in my bag.<br>How about the struggle of waking up on time? Or managing time between classes and social life. Maybe even something like losing track of expenses or what about Wet Soap Turning Mushy. Oh, and I Forget to water indoor plants., makes plant die :(&nbsp;<br><br>1. Losing small items like pens, keys, etc.<br>2. Phone battery dying during the day.<br>3. Heavy backpacks causing discomfort.<br>4. Disorganized notes and study materials.<br>5. Cluttered living space with no storage.<br>6. Mixing laundry colors and whites.<br>7. Slow drying of clothes in humid weather.<br>8. Charging cables fraying at the ends.<br>9. Forgetting to Live in the Present Moment.<br>10. Difficulty waking up on time.<br>11. Time management between studies and socializing.<br>12. Wet Soap Turning Mushy, Soap left in water becomes slimy and unhygienic.<br>13. Forgetting to water indoor plants.<br>14. Open Food Packets Getting Stale: Chips, biscuits, and snacks lose freshness if left unsealed.<br>15. Carrying a water bottle that leaks or is bulky.</p>

You scroll Instagram while eating, watch Netflix while studying, and even in quiet moments, your brain won‚Äôt shut up. It‚Äôs like living in a mental traffic jam‚Äîhorns blaring, zero movement.

Cut to 6 hours later: your once-crispy treasures are now limp, chewy, and taste like regret. Humidity attacks, ants invade, and you‚Äôre left staring at a packet of disappointment. Zip-lock bags? Too fancy. Clips? They vanish like your motivation during lectures.
